### Fibonacci numbers
This algorithm receives an input `n` and return the `n`-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. 

Formula:
```
F[1] = 1
F[2] = 1
F[n] = F[n-1] + F[n-2]
```
Output:
```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1587 ...
```

##### Implementation: 
The algorithm computes the Fibonacci sequence up to a given maximum number (`max_num`), by iterating over all numbers in range `[0, max_num]`. This protects the input `n` against timing side-channels, since the execution time of Fibonacci is linear to that input. For that matter, the privacy-preserving version computes all Fibonacci numbers up to `max_num` and return only the result corresponfing to input `n`.

CEAL Example
------------
[Encrypted Numbers](https://github.com/momalab/privacy_benchmarks/tree/master/fibonacci/fibonacci_s.sca):
Computes the Fibonacci of the number based on the input given in [input.sec](https://github.com/momalab/privacy_benchmarks/tree/master/fibonacci/input.sec) (in this case the output is `12`).
